/**
 * Names the main colours of a region — for Identify Objects and Colors and
 * the Explore screen.
 *
 * Works in HSV rather than RGB: brighter or dimmer light mostly changes a surface's value (V),
 * barely its hue (H), so each pixel is sorted into a colour family by hue first, and brightness
 * only decides black/white/grey, brown, and a "Dark"/"Light" qualifier. (The RGB nearest-match
 * this replaces called a red shirt "Dark Brown" in a dim room and "Light Red" by a window.)
 * The families are then ranked by how many pixels fall in each, and each is named from its own
 * pixels' average saturation and value.
